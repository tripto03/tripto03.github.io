I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [PIKE LAB](https://pike.psu.edu/) in the College of Information Science and Technology (IST) at Pennsylvania State University, working under the supervision of Professor [Dongwon Lee](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/dlee/). My research is centered on Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on authorship regarding Large Language Models (LLMs). As LLMs like ChatGPT gain widespread attention for their remarkable ability to generate human-like content, my work is dedicated to evaluating these models to identify subtle distinctions from human text and explore their potential to address emerging challenges and different tasks.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I served as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I also gained industry experience as a Data Science Intern at Home Depot, where I contributed to the Contact Center Data Science team during the summer of 2024.
