I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [PIKE LAB](https://pike.psu.edu/) in the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) at Pennsylvania State University, advised by Professor [Dongwon Lee](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/dlee/). My research lies in **Natural Language Processing**, with a particular focus on **authorship in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs)**. As LLMs like ChatGPT reshape how we create and consume text, my work aims to evaluate these models by uncovering subtle distinctions from human writing and developing frameworks to preserve authorship, originality, and alignment across diverse applications.  

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a **lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering** at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I have also gained industry research experience as an **Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon AWS** (memory-augmented coding agents for personalization) and as a **Data Science Intern at Home Depot** (predictive modeling and LLM-driven customer query automation).  

I am actively seeking **full-time opportunities as a Research Scientist, Software Engineer, or equivalent role**, where I can apply my expertise in NLP, machine learning, and large-scale modeling to impactful real-world problems.
